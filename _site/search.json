Git is a way to keep track of changes to your code – nothing more! The whole idea is that every change you make to a file gets tracked and you have a whole history of it. It requires a bit of discipline to learn, but as a scientist as smart as yourself, I’m sure it won’t be difficult for you.\nThe most important thing ot keep in mind is that there is a copy of the code on your computer and a copy on GitHub. When a change is made on your local computer you’ll need to push it to GitHub, and when a change is made on GitHub you’ll need to pull it to your local computer.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. GitHub Pull Model\n\n\nHopefully this image (Figure 1) can help clarify the workflow for you. If you get confused just call me 🙃"

In the following step you will create a commit and see these changes.\ngit add .\n\n🔎 Check that your files are staged\nThis command is just to check if your files were staged correctly. When you run it, you’ll see a lot of data with pluses or minuses, indicated new lines and deleted lines.\ngit diff \nOr if you just want to list the names of the files with changes, use this command:\ngit diff --name-only\n\n📄 Commit the files that you staged with the previous command\nProvide a commit message to describe what you did.\ngit commit -m \"this change includes a new page to discuss the research\"\n\n⬆️ Push your commit to GitHub\nAfter you’ve added your changes and committed them, you can push the changes up. Once pushed,\ngit push"
